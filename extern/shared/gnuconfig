GNU Config File Update

Required for extern libraries on systems not properly supported at the time their
gnu config file has been written in stone in the release files. These updated files
can be downloaded from these locations:

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.sub;hb=HEAD

From the resulting files only the config.guess and config.sub are required to be placed
in a tar.bz2 to be unpacked into respective build directories.
