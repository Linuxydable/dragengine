we need the dlls but where to get them reliably from?

under ubuntu they seem to be included in the main package and can be found here:

/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/8.3-posix/libgcc_s_seh-1.dll
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/8.3-posix/libstdc++-6.dll
/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/libwinpthread-1.dll

this is for the "posix" threading model. for the "win32" threading model use "8.3-win32"

under gentoo the wiki talks about this path:
/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/usr/bin/
