project editor.

allows to edit project settings and browsing project files to edit them.

serves also as default editor if the IGDE is opened.

screen is split into main panel and side panel on the left.

side panel contains these tabs:
- Project: shows project settings replacing the IGDE project dialog.
- Files: shows search and filter options for the files view in the main panel.
         contains these widgets:
         "Search:": text field where user can enter part of files to show in the main panel.
                    search is updated on text changing while entered
         "Type:": combo box with list of resource types to show. contains these values:
                  - All supported resource files
                  - All files
                  - One entry for each editor supported resource type like "World", "Rig".
                  editors can register which file types they can open.
                  this list collects all of thems

the main panel contains split view of the files. on the left side is a split view.

the upper panel contains a flat list of all directories matching the search filter.
if clicking on an entry shows in the large panel on the right side the unfiltered
content of the directory. files not matching the filter are grayed out to show they
are not matching the filter but can still be selected. the lower panel contains a
flat list of all files in the project directory matching the search filter. the
lists will be build using a search thread updating the lists gradually. it should
be visually visible if the search thread is still looking for files. can be done
by showing a searching icon somewhere. clicking a file in the file listnig down-left
or right opens the file in the matching editor or externally. (maybe also show system
known file types to allow opening other files outside the editor?) (maybe allow the
user to define per-project file types?)
