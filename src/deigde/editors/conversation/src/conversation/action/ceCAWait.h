 * \brief Wait Conversation Action.
 * Waits for a condition to becomes false. To avoid hammering the update interval is specified
 * in seconds. While the condition is true an optional lists of actions is processed in
 * a loop. As soon as the condition becomes false the loop is broken out of. Hence the actions
 * in the action list have to be chosen carefully to not stall the system. In general the
 * actions have to be chosen in a way that the result is sane no matter after which action
 * the processing stops. Blocking actions like the player choice action requiring user input
 * should be avoided unless the player is allowed to stop the waiting intentionally after a
 * given amount of time waiting. If the condition is missing it is assumed to be false hence
 * this action is skipped. The default test interval is 0.2 seconds.
