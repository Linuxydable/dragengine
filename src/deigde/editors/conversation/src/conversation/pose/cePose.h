 * \brief Pose.
 * A pose is a state of an actor. Every pose has an idle animation assigned
 * which is played back as long as the actor is in this pose state. While
 * changing the pose the old and new pose are blended over. The transition
 * between two poses is usually hidden using a pose leading from the old
 * pose to the new pose. This way the pose can be changed using only one
 * animation rule in the animator.
