 * Dialog to edit a string value. In addition to the FXInputDialog this dialog provides also
 * a list of strings to choose from. This is similar to the FXInputDialog choose version but
 * has a bunch of important differences. First the list is sorted by name which makes it
 * easier to find a text. Second the list is not mandatory so the text can be anything not
 * necessarily part of the list. And third the list contains 10 visible entries instead of
 * 4 which makes it easier to use larger lists.
