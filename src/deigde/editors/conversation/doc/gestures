conversation gestures:

has 3 controllers:

progress
	from 0 to the duration of the gesture action in the speak action used to fade in and out of gestures
	during playing back. the controller range and clamping is set by the playback code during runtime.
	the artists can set it whatever he wants for testing purpose as it is overwritten at runtime.

playback
	from 0 to an artist defined play time. typically this is a looping controller. the playback code does
	not touch the controller except setting the value to the elapsed time since the start of the playing
	the gesture. this is used to provide looping animations inside the gesture and is artist controlled.

variation
	from 0 to 1. the artist has to set the controller to this range. the playback code sets a random
	value upon starting playing back the gesture. this can be used to play back different variations of
	a gesture for increasing the visual diversity. the random value stays the same for the entire duration
	of the gesture.

gestures are required to apply properly over existing animations. for this there are usually two possible
solutions.

animation difference:
	an animation is faded over the existing animation state using a single animation with an animation
	difference rule. the leading time is set to the current playback time (controller 'playback' or 'progress')
	and the reference time to 0 in the same animation. this fades in the animation properly from the beginning
	and fades out properly at the end given the animation state at the end matches the one at the beginning.
	this solution is simple and fast but has the disadvantage of being restrictive on what kind of base
	animation it can be applied. this is due to the fact the animation difference is applied is always applied
	using the bone local coordinate frame. if the parent bone state is a lot different than the one used to
	create the gesture animation with the result might not look as expected.

blending:
	uses a cut off animation with blending. this fully applies the gesture animation over the base animation
	in contrary to the animation difference version. this is usually the more stable and predictable solution
	but requires more work. the animation from the animation difference case is used but with the front and
	back end cut off. the idea is to have the animation start and end in the gesture pose but at a position
	where blending in and out from the base animation yields acceptable results. the problematic part on this
	solution is picking the start and end pose and to create a good blending.
	
	the first step is adding a link to blend the animation. this link is applied to the source factor target
	of the gesture rules and is usually a simple ramp shape like this:
	
	  /-----------------\
	 /                   \
	/  A               B  \
	
	the points A and B of reaching/leaving full strength can be freely chosen to make the transition looking
	good. A and B are used for the next link to play back the animation gesture. the animation has to stand
	still while blending is done and should play back only in between point A and B. so the next link artificially
	extends the animation beyond point A and B to not interfere with the blending. trying to blend an animation
	already moving from a reference state to the gesture state would look awefully. using the freezing before A
	and after B this problem can be fixed. the link looks like this:
	
	   A  /---
	     /
	    /
	___/  B
	
	the playback is thus keep frozen at 0 before A and 1 after B. in between it ramps linearly from 0 to 1 as
	it would do with any other playback type link.
