/**
 * \brief View Editor Navigation.
 * 
 * Base class for view editors with navigation support. Navigation support is done whenever modifier buttons
 * are held while moving with the right mouse button pressed. For subclasses it is marked if navigation is
 * in progress. This way subclasses can do their own processing during mouse movement if no navigation is
 * in progress. Otherwise simply do nothing if the right mouse button is pressed during mouse move.
