/**
 * FOX Native toolBar.
 * 
 * This is done complicated here because of a peculiarity of the FOX toolkit. the toolbar
 * can be floating and docket. the floating window has to be delete always since we are
 * responsible for the reference. the toolbar we have to delete also *BUT ONLY* if not
 * parented to the floating window. this forces us to do some nasty book-keeping to
 * avoid crashes and other strange problems.
 * 
 * A solution jumping quick to mind is the floating window is declared the native widget
 * while the toolbar is declared the native container. this is not correct since the
 * toolbar widget should be the toolbar and not an imaginary window. this causes segfaults
 * while deleting since IGDE UI expects the native widget to be parented to the container
 * not an arbitrary other widget.
 * 
 * So no matter what the FXToolBar has to be the native widget. so the question is how
 * to solve the mess with the floating window. the biggest issue here is deleting the
 * toolbar widget and in the destructor being required to delete also the shell window.
 * 
 * The solution used is to move the deletion into a method of the native class. this
 * method has to delete the floating toolbar (which has to be done always) and if the
 * toolbar itself has to be deleted too.
