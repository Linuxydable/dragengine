/**
 * @brief Generic BSPTree Class.
 *
 * Provides the generic implementation of an bsp tree algorithm. For real usage subclass
 * this class and implement the required functions. Every BSPTree object is the root of
 * a bsp tree. The top most bsp tree object with no parent is the real bsp tree root and
 * all children virtual octree roots. The subclass overwrites the node creation function
 * to create nodes of its own class. Furthermore the subclass has to implement the
 * management of the node content. This bsp tree class only provides the skeleton required
 * for a bsp tree algorithm and does not implement any node content logic.
