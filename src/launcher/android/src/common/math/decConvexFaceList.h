/**
 * \brief List of convex faces that can be processed by splitters.
 * 
 * Sometimes it is useful to have a list of convex faces that
 * describe some object or multiple objects. The Convex face
 * list stores a list of convex faces and their vertices.
 * Split operations can be done on the stored convex faces.
 * The newly generated convex faces are appended to the list.
 * This way a single convex face list can be used to cut an
 * original convex face into smaller pieces.
 * 
 * The convex face list does only provide storing convex faces
 * and does not use any kind of spatial optimiziation like
 * octrees. If you need spatial optimization or if you are
 * using a large number of convex faces writing your own class
 * is a better solution.
 * 
 * You can use this class as a temporary storage to split your
 * convex faces and moving the result afterwards into a better
 * place. The extraction functions allow to remove convex faces
 * without deleting them.
