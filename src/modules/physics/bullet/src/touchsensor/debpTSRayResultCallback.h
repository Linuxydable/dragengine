/**
 * \brief Modification of \ref debpRayResultCallback for use with touch sensor shapes.
 * 
 * \ref debpRayResultCallback provides near phase collision filtering between the
 * moving collider and the colliders overlapping the touch sensor. For use with touch
 * sensor shapes though the collision filtering has to include the touch sensor too.
 * To work properly this class has to provide these collision filtering behaviors:
 * 
 * - Moving collider versus hit collider
 * - Hit collider versus parent touch sensor
 * 
 * The moving collider is not supposed to be tested against the touch sensor. Only the
 * hit collider has to be tested. This supports the situation where the touch sensor
 * filters out a collider the moving collider can hit. This can be for example due to
 * an ignore collider in the touch sensor. The near phase has to do the filtering since
 * the broad phase can not handle this well.
