/**
 * \brief Shared class for bullet physics constraint adapters.
 * \details Provides additional properties the basic bullet constraints do not offer.
 *          Furthermore provides a common base class for all bullet constraint adapters.
 *          This class is used as the second base class allowing for bullet constraint
 *          adapters to the stored as debpBPConstraintShared pointers. The object can
 *          be safely destructed with a pointer to debpBPConstraintShared.
 * \par Constraint breaking
 * Constraint breaking is tracked for all linear and angular axes even if the constraint
 * does not use them. During construction time all breaking axes are set to being not
 * broke. Calling TestBreaking(eBreakingAxes,btConstraintInfo2&,int) tests if the
 * solving parameters would break the constraint for a breaking axis. The limit impulses
 * of the solver row is compared against the breaking impulse for the breaking axis. If
 * the limit is exceeded the axis is marked as broken and the limits adjusted. The
 * breaking result can be retrieved later on to convert a constraint to a new one.
