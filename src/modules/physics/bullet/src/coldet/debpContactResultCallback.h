/**
 * \brief Contact result callback.
 * 
 * Modification version of btCollisionWorld::ContactResultCallback to support dragengine
 * specific collision filtering and calling deBaseScriptingCollider.
 * 
 * One of the main problems here is that bullet calls addSingleResult multiple times to
 * add multiple contact points including the deepest. We have though no knowledge about
 * the number of contact points added nor which one is the deepest unless we store the
 * results and compare them. We need to call the listener only once for unique combination
 * of collider, bone and shape/face ignoring multiple contact points found for them.
 * Since contact points are send one after the other a trick can be used to report a
 * collision only once. The last collision parameters are stored in the visitor. If a new
 * collision result matches the previous one we know that another point is send for the
 * same collision and the result is not send to the listener. This works well enough for
 * the situation at hand. This check can be disabled if it is known that only single
 * points are send to the visitor by the collision routines.
