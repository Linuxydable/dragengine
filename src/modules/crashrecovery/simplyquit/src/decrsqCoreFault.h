/**
 * \brief Core fault.

 * Takes over in the case of a serious core fault. Such faults can not
 * be handled anymore returning to a sane state and have to result in
 * the application exiting if possible. Since such faults are not very
 * informative this class tries to gather as much information as
 * possible before jumping the knife. For this an additional process
 * is spawned which idles waiting for a problem. If a core fault happens
 * the other process is still in a sane state and takes over while this
 * process tries to gather informations until it exits or gets killed
 * otherwise. Communication between the processes is done using files.
