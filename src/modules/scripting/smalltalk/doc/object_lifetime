The GNU Smalltalk Documentation is unfortunately very vague about how objects lifetime
is handeled by certain functions. As a result you have to check the source code to
figure out what each function actuall does. To avoid this the gathered information is
stored here.

GNU Smalltalk knows two concepts the incubator and the registry. The registry is the
long term object keeper and has to be handled manually. The incubator is a short term
object keeper and used by handle objects while function calls from C to Smalltalk are
done. Most functions work on the incubator.

With other words whenever an OOP comes around you can assume it is in the incubator.
The registry is driven manually.
