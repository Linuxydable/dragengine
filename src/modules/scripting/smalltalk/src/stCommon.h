// Smalltalk provides a macro to populate a struct with the instance
// variables of the object class. now for the class side this does
// not exist. hence a new macro has to be created which provides this
// class side attachment. using a proper pseudo subclassing of structs
// makes though more sense hence for both cases a proper struct is
// provided which can be properly subclasses by any derived class
// struct.
