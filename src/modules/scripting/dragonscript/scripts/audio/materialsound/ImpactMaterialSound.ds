/**
 * \brief Impact material sound.
 * 
 * Material sounds used for objects hitting each other. Typically used for collisions between
 * dynamic or kinematic colliders. Collider rig shapes are assigned the model texture they
 * belong to. This can be used to figure out what skins are involved in the collision. Using
 * SkinAnnotations the ImpactMaterialSound identifier for the skin file path can be looked up.
 * Each ImpactMaterialSound involved in the collision plays back an impact sound. This allows
 * to simulate a vaste amount of inter-material collisions without needing to record an explicit
 * sound for each possible combination of materials. You only need to record a collision sound
 * for each material.
