/**
 * \brief Rail defining path for elements.
 * 
 * Contains corner points defining the path for elements or other objects requiring a path
 * placed down by a level artist in the game world. Each corner has a position, orientation
 * and an order number. The order number is used to sort the corners along the rail path.
 * The rail is non-forking running from the corner with the lowest order to the corner with
 * the highest order. Adding corners inserts them sorted by their order.
 * 
 * Rails have a unique identifier. This identifier is used by elements to locate the path
 * in RailList of the GameWorld they are located in. If not found RailList.getWithID()
 * returns null. To define rails use RailList.getOrAddWithID(). This method creates the
 * rail if not found and thus always returns a Rail instance. This is required because
 * the loading order of elements in a GameWorld is not well defined.
 * 
 * While the Rail class is usually not subclasses the RailCorner is created by rail corner
 * element classes and can be subclassed to add additional properties to corners.
