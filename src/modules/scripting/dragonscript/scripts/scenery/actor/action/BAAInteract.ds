/**
 * \brief Interface for interaction support with base actor actions.
 * 
 * Implementing actions provide a primary and secondary action.
 * 
 * Primary action is the main action the player can carry out. On a computer this is typically
 * the left mouse button. On touch screen based platforms this is typically a tap motion.
 * 
 * Secondary action is an addtional action the player can carry out. On a computer this is
 * typically the right mouse button. On a touch screen based platform this is typically a
 * press motion.
 * 
 * This interface provides the most basic interaction form and is useful for simple player
 * interactions. For more complex interactions create a custom interface providing the
 * desired interactions.
