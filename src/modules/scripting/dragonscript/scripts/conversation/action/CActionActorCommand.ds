 * \brief Conversation action sending a command to an actor.
 * 
 * The command is a single text string parsed by the conversation script into
 * an array of arguments and then send to the player action. The format of the
 * command depends on the type of the player action the actor is using at the
 * time of the command being send. If the command is not understood or
 * improperly formatted the player action does nothing. Thus it is important
 * to ensure make sure this action is used in the proper situation.
