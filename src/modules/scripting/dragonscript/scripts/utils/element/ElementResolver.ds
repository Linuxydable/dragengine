/**
 * \brief Resolve element links.
 * 
 * Helper class to resolve element identifiers read from file readers. While
 * loading elements from files the elements referenced by identifiers very
 * well can not be present yet in the game world since they show up in the
 * file at a later time. To support such links the UniqueID of an element is
 * saved. Once read it has to be resolved once all elements are present in
 * the game world. The best time for this is during a call to Element.enterFrame().
 * An instance of this class has to be placed in elements requiring resolving
 * behavior. To resolve an encountered element add a resolve request to the
 * instance of this class with a block to use. The following code example
 * shows how to use this class.
 * 
 * \code{.ds}
 * class MyElement extends Element
 *    private var ElementResolver pElementResolver
 *    private var Element pElementInHands
 *    
 *    public func new()
 *       this.pElementResolver = ElementResolver.new()
 *    end
 *    
 *    public func void readFromFile( FileReader reader )
 *       ...
 *       if hasElementInHands
 *          this.pElementResolver.add( UniqueID.readFromFile( reader ), block Element resolved
 *             this.pElementInHands = resolved
 *          end )
 *       end
 *    end
 *    
 *    public func addToGameWorld()
 *       // request enterFrame() to be called once. works fine for both creating or loading
 *       // elemente. in case of creating new elements there are simply no request to resolve
 *       this.getGameWorld().addEnterFrameOnce( this )
 *    end
 *    
 *    public func void enterFrame()
 *       // resolve all elements. once finished all request are removed. if a resolve request
 *       // fails the block is called with a null element. it is the responsibility of the
 *       // block to handle this situation.
 *       this.pElementResolver.resolve( this.getGameWorld() )
 *    end
 * end
 * \endcode
 * 
 * 
 * \par BehaviorsElement Behaviors
 * 
 * This class is also able to resolve BehaviorElement behaviors. During saving you have to
 * store both the BehaviorElement UniqueID as well as the behavior instance index. The
 * DefaultECBehavior class provides this information. While resolving the block is called
 * with BehaviorInstance as parameter. In general you will change this to parameter type
 * to match the behavior stored.
 * 
 * \code{.ds}
 * class MyElement extends Element
 *    private var ElementResolver pElementResolver
 *    private var MyBehavior.Instance pElementInHands
 *    
 *    public func new()
 *       this.pElementResolver = ElementResolver.new()
 *    end
 *    
 *    public func void readFromFile( FileReader reader )
 *       ...
 *       if hasElementInHands
 *          var UniqueID id = UniqueID.readFromFile( reader )
 *          var int index = reader.readUShort()
 *          this.pElementResolver.addBehavior( id, index, block MyBehavior.Instance behavior
 *             this.pElementInHands = behavior
 *          end )
 *       end
 *    end
 *    
 *    public func addToGameWorld()
 *       // request enterFrame() to be called once. works fine for both creating or loading
 *       // elemente. in case of creating new elements there are simply no request to resolve
 *       this.getGameWorld().addEnterFrameOnce( this )
 *    end
 *    
 *    public func void enterFrame()
 *       // resolve all elements. once finished all request are removed. if a resolve request
 *       // fails the block is called with a null element. it is the responsibility of the
 *       // block to handle this situation.
 *       this.pElementResolver.resolve( this.getGameWorld() )
 *    end
 * end
 * \endcode
