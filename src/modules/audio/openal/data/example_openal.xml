	accurate but requires more processing time.

	capture far traveling sound sources better but require more

	Set maximum number of transmission during Sound Tracing. More
	transmissiong capture better complex rooms with sounds penetrating
	walls and objects but require more processing time. Incrementing
	the number of maximum transmissions by 1 typically increases
	processing time by 50-100%.

	Set number of rays to use for Estimating Room Parameters. Estimating
	room parameters is used to simulate sound effects due to room shape.
	This is a simpler version of ray tracing than used by Sound Tracing.
	This serves the purpose to estimate how a room sounds like without
	doing full ray tracing. Higher ray count is more accurate but
	requires more processing time. In general estimate room parameters
	uses higher ray count than sound tracing since it is much cheaper.

	Size in bytes of buffers to use for streaming. Smaller buffer sizes

	data.

	Disable OpenAL Extensions. Use this only if the OpenAL module detecs

	occurances of the disableExtension tag.
