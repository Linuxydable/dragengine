/**
 * \brief OpenAL source manager.
 * 
 * Keeps track of openal sources objects. Sources are limited resources
 * on the hardware and have to be reused as much as possible to avoid
 * running out of openal memory. A source object is either unbound if not
 * used by an engine resource or bound if in use. The important number is
 * used to determine what source to reassign in case not enough sources
 * are available by the hardware and is located in the range from 0 to 1
 * where 1 is the most important. The owner of an openal source object
 * has to check before each access to the source if it is still the owner.
 * This avoids the need for callback mechanisms. Source objects are only
 * held by the deoalSourceManager. Users only store a pointer. The owner
 * is identified using a memory pointer location. If the owner releases
 * the source it has to set the owner pointer to NULL.
 *
