	 * cached and not loaded the next time the game starts. This avoids loading sounds data
	 * from the original resource file if not used. Not used sounds are often used only by
	 * synthesizer modules. This flag is stored in the cache file. Hence sounds stay marked
	 * used even if during one game run they are not used.
	 * 
	 * This method has to be called whenever a speaker or microphone starts using the sound.
	 * If the buffer is not present and the sound is not streaming the samples are loaded
	 * from the original resource file, the buffer created and the samples cached.
