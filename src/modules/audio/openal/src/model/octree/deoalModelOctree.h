 * Faces can be inserted unique or duplicated. Unique is useful to find faces only once
 * but has worse distribution due to many faces in low depth nodes. Duplicated avoids
 * this problem by inserting faces into all overlapping lowest depth nodes. This works
 * best with ray tracing testing to minimize the testing.
