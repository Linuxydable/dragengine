		" amount of dead texture space required to fit an NPOT into a POT. NPOTs can though"
		" cause huge slowdown on some hardware especially ATI. In this case deferred rendering"
		" can be forced to use POTs at all times. Using POTs though GPU memory consumption"
		" tends to be a lot higher than with NPOTs. By default this is enabled to be safe."
		" If you do not have enough GPU memory you can try toggling this parameter for"
		" playing games. For multi-window applications like the editor this most probably"
