/**
 * \brief Group of instances for render tasks.
 * 
 * Instance group structs are used to group instances for render taks. A group of instances
 * is represented as one deoglRenderTaskInstance with each member of the group as a sub
 * instance. This allows adding instances to render task with O(1) complexity.
 * 
 * This class is only used by the render task to provide the grouping support in O(1)
 * complexity. No additional information is carried. The owner of this struct is responsible
 * to set up the deoglRenderTaskInstance with the appropriate information. All group members
 * share the same information then.
