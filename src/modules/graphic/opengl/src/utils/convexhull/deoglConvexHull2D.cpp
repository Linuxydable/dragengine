		// the end of the main loop we can move this all at the beginning and into the for-condition.
		// to get this working the variable i is set to bestIndex for the first run of the loop. this
		// way the moving of the initial point to the start of the list is done before the first
		// testing is conducted. furthermore exchanges happen only if in the previous loop a new point
		// has been found. it is a sort of delayed loop
