/**
 * @brief Light Probe Texture Probe.
 * Each probe contains 6 rgb-color readings indicating the color hitting the probe from
 * this direction. Probes are stored as rgb-float-color in the texture as a consecutive
 * run (each of the 6 pixels stores the color of one sample). The probes store the
 * position (vector, relative to camera) and the texture coordinates (2-integer) of the
 * first (left most) pixel in the texture.
