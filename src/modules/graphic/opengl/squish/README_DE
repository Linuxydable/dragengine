Modifications
=============

The squish code included here is modified from the original distribution
as well as various files removed to allow the code to directly compile
into the opengl module instead of having yet another library hanging
around. This also prevents compilation issues since after all the library
has to be compiled together with the module to be of any use.

The original source code can be found at: http://code.google.com/p/libsquish .

Modifications are not marked inside the source code as this would be turn
the code into a mess.
