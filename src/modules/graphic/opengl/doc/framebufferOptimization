See https://community.arm.com/graphics/b/blog/posts/mali-performance-2-how-to-correctly-handle-framebuffers

In short:
- Calling glClear() at the start of each FBO’s rendering sequence, for all attachments where
  the old value is not needed.
- Calling glInvalidateFramebuffer() or glDiscardFramebufferExt() at the end of each FBO’s
  rendering sequence, before switching to a different FBO, for all attachments which are
  simply transient working buffers for the intermediate state.

Important Note:
Scissor Test affects clearing. If scissor test is enabled a full clear with the sought
after performance improvement is not possible. Hence whenever clearing is done in the
render classes a check is done if this is the main pass (mask == NULL) or a masked path
(mask != NULL). If the clearing is done in the main pass GL_SCISSOR_TEST is explicitly
disabled for the course of the clearing then enabled again.
