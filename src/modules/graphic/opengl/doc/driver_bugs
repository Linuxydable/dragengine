nVidia Decal Slow Down
======================

This bug has been observed on the nVidia GeForce 9500M GS series on Linux with the official nVidia drivers.
The exact cause of the bug is unknown and does not happen on ATI. Chances are it is a GPU relative bug and
that it does not affect newer GPUs (tests pending).

The bug shows itself as a huge performance loss when rendering decals. The framerate drops down to a slide
show in this case. With normal geometry no problem happens. The problem is due to the roughness texture.
This texture uses a 2-component format. Using 2-component format the slow down happens. If changed to a
3-component format the slow down goes away. Since the only difference between normal geometry and decals
is the use of blending the conclusion is that blending on a 2-component format causes the massive slow
down on nVidia chips.

As a fix a configuration value is used to fix this problem on an nVidia system. Later on there might be
use for an additional field in the roughness texture which could fix the problem without having to waste
GPU memory space for nothing.
