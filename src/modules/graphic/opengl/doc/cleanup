This document contains a bunch of bash scripts that are useful to help cleaning up external files not
required anymore. These files are typically left over from development cycles.



Shaders
-------
This bash script lists *.shader.xml files that are no longer referenced in the source code. This script
has to be run from the opengl/shaders directory. The script does not remove files directly. Replace
"echo $f" with "svn delete $f" for this to happen.

for f in `find -name "*.shader.xml"`; do
   NAME=`grep "\s*<name>[^<]\+</name>" $f | sed -e "s@\s*<name>\([^<]\+\)</name>@\1@g"`
   TEST=`find ../src -name "*.cpp" | xargs -- grep -nH "GetSourcesNamed(\s*\"$NAME\"\s*)"`
   if [[ -z $TEST ]]; then
      echo $f;
   fi
done



Shader Sources
--------------
This bash script lists *.glsl files that are no longer referenced by *.shader.xml files. This script has
to be run from the opengl/shaders directory. The script does not remove files directly. Replace "echo $f"
with "svn delete ../shaderSources/$f" for this to happen.

for f in `cd ../shaderSources; find -type f | sed -e "s@\\./@@g"`; do
   TEST1=`find -name "*.shader.xml" | xargs -- grep -nHF "$f"`
   TEST2=`find ../src -name "*.cpp" | xargs -- grep -nHF "\"$f\""`
   if [[ -z $TEST1 && -z $TEST2 ]]; then
      echo $f;
   fi
done
