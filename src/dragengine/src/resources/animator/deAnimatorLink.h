/**
 * \brief Animator controller link.
 *
 * Describes a controller linked to a rule. This class stores besides
 * the index of the controller in the animator also two transformation
 * parameters. These can be used to alter the value obtained from the
 * controller to reuse controllers. The controller value is first clamped
 * by the lower and upper clamp boundaries. Controller always yield a
 * value in the range from 0 to 1. The default clamp boundaries of 0 for
 * the lower and 1 for the upper therefore leave the controller value
 * untouched. The clamped value is then multiplied by the multiplier
 * parameter and then offset by the offset parameter. Summed up the final
 * value returned by this link equals to
 * "value = offset + clamp( controllerValue, lower, upper ) * multiplier.
 * The default value is 0 for offset and 1 for the multiplier. The
 * transformation parameters should map the values from the range 0-1 back
 * into the range 0-1. Certain rules can provide exceptions to allow
 * special effects for which especially clamping can be useful.
