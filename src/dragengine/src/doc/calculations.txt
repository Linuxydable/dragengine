bone:
	different types of bone to optimize space usage.
	typical types:
		full complex:
			position and orientation both change nearly
			every frame. no frame time is saved but all
			frames in increasing order. position and
			rotation stored. total cost 12*N where N is
			the number of frames.
		
		partial complex:
			like above but only the position never changes.
			initial position saved before the frame data.
			total cost 6+6*N.
		
		full simple:
			position and orientation both change scarcely
			over the animation requiring only a few actual
			keyframes. time, position and rotation stored.
			total cost 14*N.
		
		partial simple:
			as above but only with rotation. position again
			in front. total cost 6+8*N.
		
		constant:
			no change of position or rotation over time.
			both stored once. total cost 12.
		
keyframe:
	time:
		number of keyframe is enough since frame rate is
		known. unsigned short is enough.
		
	position:
		-30.000 -> 30.000 ( signed short : 2 )
		=> 6 bytes pro position
		usually not required at all
		
	rotation:
		-180.00 -> 180.00 ( signed short : 2 )
		=> 6 bytes pro rotation
		most of the time some components are 0
	
	best case:
		no position => 6 bytes for rotation
	worst case
		12 bytes for all



examples:
	10 seconds at 50 frames per second => 500 frames.
	
	full complex: 6'000
	partial complex: 3'006
